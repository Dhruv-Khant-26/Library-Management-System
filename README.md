# Library-Management-System

Overview-<br>

The Library Management System is a C++ console application designed to manage a library's book inventory. It allows users to add, display, search, delete, issue, and return books, with persistent storage in a text file (books.txt). The system is built with object-oriented principles, featuring a Book class for book details and a Library class for managing operations. The project includes VS Code configuration files for building, running, and debugging the application using g++ and gdb.<br><br>

Tech Stack-<br>
C++: Core programming language (C++11 standard) for implementing the application logic.<br>
g++: Compiler for building the C++ code.<br>
gdb: Debugger for troubleshooting, integrated with VS Code.<br>
VS Code: Development environment with configured tasks and launch settings.<br>
File I/O: Uses fstream for persistent storage of book records in books.txt.<br><br>

Prerequisites-<br>
C++ compiler (e.g., g++ for MinGW on Windows, or installed via GCC on Linux/macOS)<br>
gdb debugger (included with MinGW or GCC installations)<br>
Visual Studio Code (recommended for development and debugging)<br>
Operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS<br>
